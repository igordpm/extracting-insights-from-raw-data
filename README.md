# Extracting insights from raw data

## < under construction >

#### « this is meant to be a tutorial for beginners »

The goal of this repo is to generate as many insights as possible from raw data taken from the internet (thanks, [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail+II)). The goal is to go through all steps in details, from data cleaning to building machine learning models. Each step has its own [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).


* What to expect:
  - Data cleaning;
  - Temporal analysis and Streamlit;
  - Predictive analysis;
